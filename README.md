- 👋 Hi, I’m Cheng Wee!
- 👀 I’m a recent graduate from the NUS Faculty of Science (Food Science and Technology).
- 🌱 Currently,I am learning more about coding and fintech as I believe that this will be the next big thing in the economy, and I can't wait to be an early adopter!
- 💞️ Additionally, I am looking to collaborate on fintech/backend jobs, or any exposure to digital services at this point!
- 📫 Feel free to reach me at yeam.cw@gmail.com if you have any questions for me :)
